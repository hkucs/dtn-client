1. plot
2. notify_dest
3. traffic arrival pattern

Figures:
- Comp our sched v.s. FIFO
- req/time, sched_job/time
- latency
- 

2013-05-08 TODO:
- figures (what to draw, be able to draw)
- FIFO (disgard tasks that misses deadline)
- traffic generation
- notify_dest does not affect scheduling.

2013-05-09
- two pages of experiments (figures)
- check whether it is the last chunk. (using #threads and chunk_size)

2013-05-10:
figures:
- utilization of VM resources.
- link utilization (using number of handler threads)
- Memory

2013-05-11:
- Figure: {X: time slot; Y: sum(utility for each req)}
- Figure: {X: time slot; Y: sum(job completed. req)}
- Figure: {X: time slot; Y: threads (indicates bandwidth utililization)}
- Figure: {X: job_id; Y: deadline and completed time}
- Figure: gateway performance (mem, cpu, disk, etc.)
- requests: 0 ~ 5 persec
- X20 in scale
